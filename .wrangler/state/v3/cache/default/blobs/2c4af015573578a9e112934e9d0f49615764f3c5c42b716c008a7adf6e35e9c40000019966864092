With summer break over, a new semester of fall events awaits. There’s the annual academy festival, the sports meet—the list goes on! As I walk to class on my first day, my heart races in anticipation at what my new campus life will be like. That is, until students start approaching me a short distance from the campus gate… You see, Ainoshima Academy has two student councils that are always vying against each other. Here, let me break it down for you real quick:\nGekka Council: Steeped in history and tradition, Gekka is as old as the academy itself. Its supporters wear uniforms featuring flowing, dark-green skirts for added noblesse.\nGekka President Alicetia: “Join Gekka… Let’s be friends…”\nTendo Council: Tendo is a new student council that was formed after Gekka. Its supporters prefer a dress style that incorporates the latest in uniform chic, including burgundy bolero jackets, pleated miniskirts, and neckties.\nTendo President Usagi: “Join Tendo—let’s get this academy inspired!”\nMeanwhile, various student associations have been involved in a proxy war, with the sports teams supporting Gekka and the liberal arts clubs backing Tendo. Before I transferred, the student vote was split evenly between them, which means my vote will be the one that decides who gets the majority! Word has it that a similar deadlock happened six years ago, and it was a transfer student who broke it. Coincidence, huh? Anyway, as you can imagine, since day one of me moving here, neither faction will give me a moment’s peace! This isn’t how my sister said it would be at all…?!\nGekka Vice President Mashiro: “I wish the sports jocks and liberal arts gang could just get along.”\nTendo Secretary Tateha: “With your vote, something might actually change around here.”\nI was planning to live my new campus life in peace, but as the academy’s 777th student, the entire student population is watching my every move. Being 777 might sound like the jackpot, but the way things are going, I just might be the unluckiest guy here…\nWith two student councils to deal with, plus the ongoing proxy war, my new life at Ainoshima Academy is already off to a challenging start!\nGAMEPLAY &#038; FEATURES\n&#8211; 15 hours of story\n&#8211; A branching visual novel\n&#8211; Full Japanese voice acting by seasoned professionals\nThis Game may contain content not appropriate for all ages or may not be appropriate for viewing at work.\n\nMinimum System Requirements:\nSystem: Windows XP\nProcessor: PentiumM 1.5GHz or higher\nMemory: 2 GB RAM\nGraphics: 1280&#215;720 Resolution\nSound Card: PCM Support\nRecommended System Requirements:\nSystem: Windows 8\nProcessor: Core 2 Duo 2.6GHz or higher\nMemory: 4 GB RAM\n\nScreen Shots:\n\n\n\nVideo(s):\n\n\nFREE GOG PC GAMES PRESENTS\nPrimal Hearts 2 (c) Marmalade / Shiravune\nAs new rivalries and old divisions threaten to split Ainoshima apart once again, only a new “Triple Seven” can restore peace once more!

The holy war is over! Your oppressors have been vanquished, the churches of the Old God lay in ruin and thousands of innocent people have been murdered! But it&#8217;s not all good news; the tyrant Heavenly Peter has escaped your clutches, and you have been tasked with the mission of finding him&#8230;\nYour journey will take you through a richly detailed landscape built from hundreds of different Renaissance paintings. You will steal a ship, feed a donkey, compete in a talent contest, assist an inept street magician, sing, dance, play the (magic?) flute, poke a man&#8217;s face, hunt for treasure and have a chat with Our Lord God Almighty&#8230; But will you find Heavenly Peter? And if you do, how will you take your revenge!?\nFeatures\n-Pointing and Clicking – A traditional point and click interface, with a &#8216;verb coin&#8217; interaction menu and a simple inventory from which you can drag and drop your preciously hoarded items.\n-Renaissance Artwork – Paintings by Rembrandt, Botticelli, Michelangelo and many more are brought together into one consistent world, in a way that is also as sympathetic as possible to the original works.\n-Classical Music – a soundtrack selected to fit with the style of the artwork. Music from classical composers such as Vivaldi, Bach and George Frideric Handel will accompany you on your journey.\n-Standalone Story – The Procession to Calvary is set in the same world as Four Last Things, but its story can be played independently.\n-Optional Murder – You will be equipped with a sword. This will become useful in a number of different situations, but you will be strongly discouraged from using it on people. Ignoring this advice – and murdering anyone who stands in your way – will serve as a useful method of skipping any puzzles you don&#8217;t like. But be warned; your actions might come back to haunt you&#8230;\n-Nonsense – A style of humour reminiscent of the surreal, anarchic comedy of Monty Python. Lofty subject matter is treated with refreshing flippancy. Gags about butts are taken very seriously. But rest assured, while some of the jokes may be ridiculous, the puzzles make perfect sense! (or at least adhere to a consistent internal logic)\n-Moments of Surprising Profundity – Actually, no&#8230; Don&#8217;t read too much into it.\n\nMinimum System Requirements:\nSystem: Windows XP\nProcessor: 2 GHz &#8211; Dual Core\nMemory: 2 GB RAM\nDirectX: Version 10\nStorage: 1 GB available space\nRequires a 64-bit processor and operating system\nRecommended System Requirements:\nSystem: Windows XP, Vista, 7, 8, 10\nProcessor: 2 GHz &#8211; Dual Core\nMemory: 4 GB RAM\nDirectX: Version 11\nStorage: 1 GB available space\nRequires a 64-bit processor and operating system\n\nScreen Shots:\n\n\n\nVideo(s):\n\n\nFREE GOG PC GAMES PRESENTS\nThe Procession to Calvary (c) Joe Richardson / Akupara Games\nPilfer from pirates, conspire with cardinals and perform miracles with an incompetent magician.

Seek out powerful weapons and artifacts by day, stand against his minions by night, and prepare to be hunted by powerful entities from ages past in this roguelite role-playing game.\nEvery three days, a terrifying new minion of the Demon King begins his hunt, drawn from a pool of over 30 potential bosses. Study each monster’s strengths and unique powers, and adapt your build accordingly. Explore the realm in search of the weapons and equipment best suited to defeat this powerful predator, but be wary of other fell creatures that roam the world by night. With limited time, will you opt to sharpen your blade at hidden ancient forges, pay a high price for rare trinkets from greedy merchants, or seek out mighty armor and magical shields? Choose the tools that work best against the powerful enemy that hunts you today, without sacrificing your preparedness for what comes next, overcoming the guardians of each realm until the Demon King Himself stands before you.\nPursue a multitude of strategies and synergies with over 350 items at your disposal to confront the unique challenge of each monstrous boss. When hunted by the Razorclaw Grizzly, whose fierce attacks ignore all armor, how much armor will you sacrifice for equipment that prioritizes  maximum health, speed, or damage? The lesser monsters stalking the realms will wage a war of attrition against an unarmored hero, and should the Razorclaw Grizzly be slain, three days may not provide enough time to gather enough armor for the next great foe that hunts you. You may, in place of armor, find several items that enhance your speed and attack strength, allowing you to strike first and hard, vanquishing your enemy swiftly – sometimes before it’s able to strike at all. Then, if you luck upon the Saffron Feather, you’d be able to take advantage of your high speed to help regenerate wounds during battle. But should you find yourself hunted by the Black Knight, who absorbs your attack power as his own, high armor becomes a priority over raw attack strength – with the aid of Razor Scales armor to reflect damage back upon your enemy, and enchanted Ruby Earrings to inflict damage every other turn, the Black Knight would face steady damage without raw attack power to absorb for himself. But if you happen upon a powerful magical weapon, do you dare take it up, knowing it will strengthen the Black Knight for the fight ahead, but come to your aid should you survive it?\nThere are a plethora of options for each threat, with a variety of powerful combinations to be discovered and exploited at your disposal among the countless items, and constant tradeoffs between the near and long-term threats – with limited space in your inventory, you must choose wisely and adapt constantly.\nHe is Coming also features an asynchronous multiplayer mode, Kingmaker – seek out the fallen Demon King’s crown in an ultimate test of your strategies where your champion faces off against the powerful builds of other players. Plan around the equipment and abilities of these would-be heroes in the hunt for the crown, and face a constant onslaught of unique combinations and unforeseeable circumstances – how will you rise above all others?\nYou will face both great victories and noble defeats. Each run will contribute to your progression as you complete over 100 unique challenges that add powerful new artifacts to the pool of items available for future runs – while your first hero may not defeat the Demon King, their efforts will not be in vain.\nThe world descends slowly into chaos as the Demon King grows in strength – the trees wither away, the grass turns to ash, and the bogs turn putrid with the stench of death. Take on the mantle of a hero and prepare yourself – for He is Coming.\n\nMinimum System Requirements:\nSystem: Windows® 10 (64-bit)\nProcessor: Intel® Core™ 2 Duo E7500 (dual-core) / AMD® Athlon™ II X2 250 (dual-core)\nMemory: 2 GB RAM\nGraphics: NVIDIA® GeForce® GTX 460 (1 GB) / AMD® Radeon™ HD 5830 (1 GB)\nDirectX: Version 11\nStorage: 400 MB available space\nRecommended System Requirements:\nSystem: Windows® 10 (64-bit)\nProcessor: Intel® Core™ i5-750 (quad-core) / AMD® Phenom™ II X4 965 (quad-core)\nMemory: 4 GB RAM\nGraphics: NVIDIA® GeForce® GT 630 (2 GB) / AMD® Radeon™ HD 6670 (2 GB)\nDirectX: Version 11\nStorage: 400 MB available space\n\nScreen Shots:\n\n\n\nVideo(s):\n\n\nFREE GOG PC GAMES PRESENTS\nHe is Coming (c) Chronocle / Hooded Horse\nDeep in the forgotten corners of the world, a dark force stirs – the Demon King rises once more.
